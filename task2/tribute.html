            <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.</p>
            <p>He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.</p>

                <h2>Some interesting facts about Abdul Kalam's life:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>He was once asked by a journalist how he would like to be remembered: as a scientist, a president, or a teacher. And he replied smilingly – “I want to be remembered as a teacher first and then as any other person.”</li>
                    <li>During his presidency, Kalam was so beloved that people requested that he take the office again after Pratibha Patil’s term as President. However, he politely refused.</li>
                    <li>Kalam is the first unmarried president and scientist in India.</li>
                    <li>He was awarded the MTV Youth Icon award twice, in 2003 and 2006.</li>
                    <li>He also refused to sit on special chairs during events because he was a humble man and always promoted equality.</li>

                <h2>Why Abdul Kalam was the 'People's President'</h2>
                <p>He remains undoubtedly the most loved and admired Indian after Jawaharlal Nehru and in sheer numbers, easily tens of thousands more adored him than the first prime minister of India. What has made Avul Pakir Jainulabudeen Abdul Kalam so admired is his humble beginnings, from hawking newspapers to becoming a fierce nationalist, inspiring generations of younger Indians even in his later years. He passed away while lecturing at the Indian Institute of Management, Shillong, staying true to his commitment to education and youth.</p>
